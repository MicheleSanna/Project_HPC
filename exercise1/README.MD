# Exercise 1 - Parallel Programming

### Foundations of HPC @ UniTS-DSSC 2022

This project should run just by loading the openMPI module and running the make command. Currently it's compiled to run on epyc nodes (so with architecture/AMD). This project follows the rules specified in the assignment pdf, the only different thing is that the initialized playground is not void, it contains a bunch of gliders to check if the program is running correctly

The rules of the project were different with respect to the original one, so i made a macro to switch between them. Right now the project is setted with the official version of the rules
