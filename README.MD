# Final assigments  FHPC course 2022/2023

This is my final assignment. I've done the report as the exercise 1 and 2 were completely separated, so the structure of the report itself is done as they were two reports merged, exercise 1 first and then exercise 2. 
I've tried to keep the exercise 1 folder as clean as possible, but in the code is hardcoded an initial configuration (a glider column) to keep track of the behaviour of the program if you choose the initPlayground option.
